# MyNightmareCLI

This Coffee CLI App was built in ruby as a project for Flatiron School. 
This project required scraping a website for some basic information. Philz Coffee website was used: https://www.philzcoffee.com/shop.
This Coffee CLI App will allow you to learn more about the coffee products that Philz Coffee offers. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'my_nightmare_CLI'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install my_nightmare_CLI

## Usage

At the start up of the page, you will see a list of blends Philz Coffee provides. From there, it will take you to different coffees that are availables for a specific blend. If you are interested in more information for each coffee, the app will prompt for your input/choice before displaying the coffee description. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
